SomeExtensions
==============

This is a set of useful refactorings that are builded on top of Roslyn. 
The main purpose of this project to provide not ideal, but fast toolset.
You can consider it as replacement of ReSharper if you don't need all power of ReSharper and you are agree with my opinion that development tools must not be ideal, they must work and work pretty fast.
